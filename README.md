This is a graph based airline model which includes modeling flight routes as a graph (vertices: cities, edges: flights). 
Implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path (finding the cheapest/fastest route). Uses a priority queue to manage 
seat bookings. Run DijkstraTest.java to see comprehensive test coverage, or use Main.java to use a user interface for 
inputting your own data. https://github.com/Steven-Sunny/Airline_Sys_With_Dijkstras_Algorithm
